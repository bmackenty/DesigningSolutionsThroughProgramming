# Welcome

This repository is for our introduction to web programming class, targeted for 9th grade students (14 and 15 years old).

For many students, this is their first programming class, where they write programs in an IDE, upload changes to a remote server, work with the Linux operating system, MYSQL, work with git \(a little\), and use PHP, CSS, HTML and the Bootstrap framework to create a "real" program.  
  
Students will use these templates as a starting point to build a web application. 

I know there are some security and performance issues here. I often first sacrifice complexity and the "right way" to help students understand the basics and then slowly build more formal, secure \(and performant\) code. I also try to over-comment code to help beginning programmers understand how things work.

This code assumes a LAMP environment: Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP. We assume a very specifically setup database with specific tables. There is a file here named store_setup.php which will help you setup your store. We host on Linode.

If you have any suggestions or ideas for improvement, please email Bill MacKenty, bmackenty@aswarsaw.org or bmackenty@gmail.com, or open an issue.
