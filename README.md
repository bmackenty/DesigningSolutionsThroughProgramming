# DesigningSolutionsThroughProgramming
For our introduction to web programming class, targeted for 9th grade students. 

Students will use these templates as a starting point to build a web application. I know there are huge security issues here, especially with our database querires being non-PDO and passwords being stored as plaintext. 

Both of those issues will be addressed in future versions of this template code.

If you have any suggestions or ideas for improvement, please email Bill MacKenty, bmackenty@aswarsaw.org or bmackenty@gmail.com
