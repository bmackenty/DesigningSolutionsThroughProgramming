# Welcome

For many students, this is their first programming class, where they write programs in an IDE, upload changes to a remote server, work with the Linux operating system, MYSQL, work with git \(a little\), and use PHP, CSS, HTML and the Bootstrap framework to create a "real" program.  
  
Students will use these templates as a starting point to build a web application. 

I know there are some security and performance issues here. I often first sacrifice complexity and the "right way" to help students understand the basics and then slowly build more formal, secure \(and performant\) code. I also try to over-comment code to help beginning programmers understand how things work.

This code assumes a LAMP environment: Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP. We assume a very specifically setup database with specific tables. I should add an installer / check script. We host on Linode.

If you have any suggestions or ideas for improvement, please email Bill MacKenty, bmackenty@aswarsaw.org or bmackenty@gmail.com, or open an issue.
